/*
 * the sequencer creates sequences of edge insertions and deletions.
 * this can be done randomly, using some specific method or by reading
 * dynamic graphs from file.
 * 
 * initially, it will support creating
 * - sequences with n nodes, k steps and only random additions 
 * - sequences with n nodes, k steps and random additions and deletions
 * - sequences with n nodes, k steps and an average size of m edges (sliding window), constructed using random additions and deletions
 * - sequences with n nodes, k steps and an average size of m edges, where additions/deletions follow the idea of bergamini and meyerhenke.
 * - sequences from koblenz-files, where n and k are read from the file (only additions)
 * - sequences from koblenz-files, where n and k are read from the file and which maintains an average size of m edges (sliding window)
 * - sequences from koblenz-files, where n and k are read from the file and which maintains an average size of m edges (bergamini, meyerhenke)
 * - sequences from koblenz-files with n nodes, k steps, where n and k are given (only additions)
 * - sequences from koblenz-files with n nodes, k steps, where n and k are given and which maintains an average size of m edges (sliding window)
 * - sequences from koblenz-files with n nodes, k steps, where n and k are give and which maintains an average size of m edges (bergamini, meyerhenke)
